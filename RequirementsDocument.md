# Informal description
Medium companies and retailers need a simple application to manage the relationship with suppliers and the inventory of physical items stocked in a physical warehouse. 
The warehouse is supervised by a manager, who supervises the availability of items. When a certain item is in short supply, the manager issues an order to a supplier. In general the same item can be purchased by many suppliers. The warehouse keeps a list of possible suppliers per item. 

After some time the items ordered to a supplier are received. The items must be quality checked and stored in specific positions in the warehouse. The quality check is performed by specific roles (quality office), who apply specific tests for item (different items are tested differently). Possibly the tests are not made at all, or made randomly on some of the items received. If an item does not pass a quality test it may be rejected and sent back to the supplier. 

Storage of items in the warehouse must take into account the availability of physical space in the warehouse. Further the position of items must be traced to guide later recollection of them.

The warehouse is part of a company. Other organizational units (OU) of the company may ask for items in the warehouse. This is implemented via internal orders, received by the warehouse. Upon reception of an internal order the warehouse must collect the requested item(s), prepare them and deliver them to a pick up area. When the item is collected by the other OU the internal order is completed. 

EZWH (EaSy WareHouse) is a software application to support the management of a warehouse.



# Stakeholders


| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
|   Companies  and retailers employees    | They wish to organize their inventory and manage different relationships with the app|
| Manager | Can supervise the availability of items. The manager has an administrator role | 
|	Suppliers		| They provide the different types of items which the companies and retailers wish to manage|
|	Quality office	| They set the quality standart and testing of items ordered from different suppliers| 
|	OU 				| OU(organizational units) are subparts of the company which have the need to ask and manage items from the companys warehouse|
|	Payment service	| Service which will allow companies to pay directly to their suppliers for the ordered items|
|	Competitors	| Other applications that provide similar services|
|	Items	| Products that must be managed in the warehouse|


# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram
\<Define here Context diagram using UML use case diagram>

\<actors are a subset of stakeholders>

## Interfaces
\<describe here each interface in the context diagram>

\<GUIs will be described graphically in a separate document>

| Actor | Logical Interface | Physical Interface  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|
| Companies and retailers employees | Graphical User Interface | Screen, keyboard |
| Manager  | Graphical User Interface | Screen, keyboard |
| Item  | ReadBarCode  | Laser Beam (Bar Code Reader) |
| Payment service | APIs (e.g: PayPal: https://developer.paypal.com/home)  | Internet Connection  |
| Organizational Units  | InternalOrderReceived | Internal Network |
| Quality Office employees  | Graphical User Interface | Screen, Keyboard |

# Stories and personas
\<A Persona is a realistic impersonation of an actor. Define here a few personas and describe in plain text how a persona interacts with the system>

\<Persona is-an-instance-of actor>

\<stories will be formalized later as scenarios in use cases>


# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

\<In the form DO SOMETHING, or VERB NOUN, describe high level capabilities of the system>

\<they match to high level use cases>

| ID        | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  FR1 		| User Management |
|   FR1.1 	| User registration|
|     FR1.1.1 	| User profile setting|
|   FR1.2 	| User Log in|
|   FR1.3 	| User Log out|
|	FR1.4 	| User profile management|  
|  FR2 		| Sales management  |
|   FR2.1 	| Start sale transaction|
|   FR2.2 	| End sale transaction|
|  FR3 		| Warehouse management|
|   FR3.1 	| Inventory management|
| 	 FR3.1.1 	| Low supply notification|
|	 FR3.1.2 	| Item requested by internal entity|
|	 FR3.1.3 	| Item requested to supplier|
| ------------- |:-------------:| 

## Non Functional Requirements

\<Describe constraints on functional requirements>

| ID        | Type (efficiency, reliability, ..)           | Description  | Refers to |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| -----:|
|  NFR1     |   |  | |
|  NFR2     | |  | |
|  NFR3     | | | |
| NFRx .. | | | | 


# Use case diagram and use cases


## Use case diagram
\<define here UML Use case diagram UCD summarizing all use cases, and their relationships>


\<next describe here each use case in the UCD>
### Use case 1, UC1
| Actors Involved        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the UC can start> |
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after UC is finished> |
|  Nominal Scenario     | \<Textual description of actions executed by the UC> |
|  Variants     | \<other normal executions> |
|  Exceptions     | \<exceptions, errors > |

##### Scenario 1.1 

\<describe here scenarios instances of UC1>

\<a scenario is a sequence of steps that corresponds to a particular execution of one use case>

\<a scenario is a more formal description of a story>

\<only relevant scenarios should be described>

| Scenario 1.1 | |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the scenario can start> |
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after scenario is finished> |
| Step#        | Description  |
|  1     |  |  
|  2     |  |
|  ...     |  |

##### Scenario 1.2

##### Scenario 1.x

### Use case 2, UC2
..

### Use case x, UCx
..



# Glossary

\<use UML class diagram to define important terms, or concepts in the domain of the system, and their relationships> 

\<concepts are used consistently all over the document, ex in use cases, requirements etc>

# System Design
\<describe here system design>

\<must be consistent with Context diagram>

# Deployment Diagram 

\<describe here deployment diagram >
