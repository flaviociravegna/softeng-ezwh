Estimate effort and duration:
(this are estimatios on based on our previous work and projects from other courses)
	| task 	| Effort (person hours) |
	|------|:---------------------:|
	| Identify stockholders and actors | 6 |
	| Identify user requirements | 20 |
	| Identify performance requirements| 10 |
	| Identify use cases | 6 |
	| Identify scenarios | 20 |
	| Produce a prototype GUI | 18 |
	| Set a schedule | 8 |
	| Coding | 160 |
	| Documentation | 15 |
	| Write test cases | 4 |
	| check validity of test cases and corrections | 30 |

	|Total: | 272 |
	Assuming an equal distribution of work: aproximatelly it would be 55.5 hours of continious work.
	without taking into account missing tasks.


Estimate cost:
	We also assume the software for development is the one we already have/use therefor is not added to the cost
	(assuming each member of the group as a junior developer, with a cost of 200 euro per day per person)

	A fast estimation of the cost would be 272*200= 54,400 euros for the production of the project

	(we should assume that a server is necessary for the application and that would be set as part of the maintenance cost of the app.).
